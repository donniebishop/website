My name's Donnie, but I prefer bushidoboy.

I used to be known as covabishop, but I'm soon retiring that moniker in favor of bushidoboy.

I make music, program things, write pretty letters, watch too much anime, and obsess over my cat.

I've been making music since I was just a little 12 year old boy with dreams of making people's hearts happy.

I program because I love the act of writing words and watching computers come to life.

I watch anime because the Japanese make good cartoons. Not much else to it.

My cat's name is Shinobu. She's a sweetheart and I love her very much.

I hope I can make you happy.
