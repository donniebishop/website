Call me bushidoboy.

I am a musician, programmer, artist, learner, cat lover, anime enthusiast, and several other things you don't care about.

I've been playing music since I was 12, and producing music since the age of 16.

I have experience programming in Python and Rust, and am a supporter of Open Source technologies.

I adopted my cat in 2018. Her name is Shinobu and I love her very much.
