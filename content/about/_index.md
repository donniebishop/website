My name's Donnie, but I prefer bushidoboy.

I used to be known as covabishop, but I'm soon retiring that moniker in favor of bushidoboy.

I make music, program things, watch too much anime, and obsess over my cat.

I'm neurotic and a notorious rambler. If I get tiresome, I'm sorry, and I'll try to be better.

My cat's name is Shinobu. She's a sweetheart and I love her very much.

I hope I can make you happy.
