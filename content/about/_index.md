My name's Donnie, but I prefer bushidoboy.

I make music, program things, write pretty letters, watch too much anime, and obsess over my cat.

I've been making music since I was just a little 12 year old boy with dreams of making people's hearts happy.

My cat's name is Shinobu. She's a sweetheart and I love her very much.
