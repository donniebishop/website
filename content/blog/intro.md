So, this is the first post to my website. Just testing out hugo right now, and learning to customize it to fit my needs and what I want this website to be.

This site is going to be mostly for my personal use and interests, but will likely start shifting towards my music as I get back into making music as bushidoboy.

Hope you'll come along with me on my journey <3
