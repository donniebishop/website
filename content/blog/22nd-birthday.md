So I turned 22 yesterday. Still not used to celebrating my own birthday, as I never did when I was growing up. I won't go into why that's the case, but here we are, celebrating my 22nd.

Woke up around 7AM, realized I was late for work, and decided I deserved a day off. Called out, put some food out for Shinobu and went back to sleep for a few hours.

Got up and decided March 28th would be a good day to finish up my re-playthrough of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, as it was the 16th anniversary of it's release. Went to Olympus Colisseum, grinded out the rest of the Hades Cup, and beat Ansem with a little more ease than the last time I tried it. 

Note to self: Don't play the KH games on Proud mode. What a mistake. Went from God of War to Dark Souls in an instant.

The evening was a little more eventful. My significant other dropped by in a very pretty dress and treated me to a steak dinner at a nice restaurant around the corner. We came back to the apartment and cuddled on the couch, sipping Sweet Riesling and watching Kimi No Na Wa. Ended the night with plenty of kisses, and one of the sweetest cards I've ever received. 

So here I am, at 10AM on the 29th, and I'm at work and procrastinating by writing this blog post. Freshly 22, coming off the best and only birthday celebration I've ever had. Getting old and feeling older all the time. I guess it doesn't feel much different than 21, but who knows what'll change by now and 23. 

Guess I'll have to wait and see.
