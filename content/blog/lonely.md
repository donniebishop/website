I've been feeling very lonely lately.

It's the kind of loneliness that's pervasive. I feel it everywhere I go and I can never truly escape it. I'm not sure if it's just the change in seasons, the upcoming holidays, or the fact that I just passed one year since breaking up with my girlfriend. But it's starting to follow me.

I feel it when I come home and just lay on the couch with my cat for hours. I feel it resounding inside my guitar every time I play. I feel it in each drag of my cigarette. I feel it in the bottom of every bottle. I feel it in empty and pointless projects in Bitwig. I feel it every mile I drive in my car. I feel it in every moment when I'm falling to sleep.

This deep, pervasive sadness that no matter where I go, and no matter what I do, I'm all alone. I won't get existential here, saying broad truisms like "everyone's alone", "the universe feels so alone" or anything like that. 

I don't care about the universe. I'm much more selfish than that.

I feel alone. I feel depressed. I feel like there's no one here for me and that I'll never crawl out of this bottomless expanse.

I'm not asking for pity. I'm not asking for anyone to ask me "Is everything alright?" or "You can talk to me if you need anything." Why do I have to initiate? Even if I do, I just get blown off. People are too busy, preoccupied, or just too lazy to see me. 

I'll do anything, I'll go anywhere, I'll pay anything. I just want a friend. 

I just want someone that says hi to me once in a while. That sends me funny things because it made them laugh. That calls me because they were thinking about me. That asks me to come to the movies because there's one they really want to see. That asks me to help them move because their other friends bailed.

I don't care if I'm the last person on your mind. The fact that I'm on someone's mind is enough. I don't need the best, I just need enough. I just need something. Someone.

Is that really so wrong? Is that really so hard? Am I really that undeserving?
